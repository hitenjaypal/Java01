//In Java, all function definitions must be inside classes. We also call functions methods

// Access Specifier: Access specifier or modifier is the access type of the method. It specifies the visibility of the method. Java provides four types of access specifier:

// Public: The method is accessible by all classes when we use public specifier in our application.
// Private: When we use a private access specifier, the method is accessible only in the classes in which it is defined.
// Protected: When we use protected access specifier, the method is accessible within the same package or subclasses in a different package.
// Default: When we do not use any access specifier in the method declaration, Java uses default access specifier by default. It is visible only from the same package only.


// public class Main {
//     public static void foo() {
//          Do something here
//     }
// }
